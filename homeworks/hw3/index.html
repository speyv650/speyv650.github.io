          It accepts us unconditionally, with open arms and not an ounce of judgement. Home is a safe space to learn the lessons we need to take on the world. It’s our foundation, our beginning, and our end. Home is a North star for the lost and weary. To me, home has never been any location in particular. It comes to me in flashes of tearful and smiling faces, and tender moments with the people I love most; particularly in moments in which the sensation of their touch has brought me instant relief or comfort. Namely,

  <h1>Momma</h1>

  <p>My mother and I have a fraught relationship; perhaps because we are so similar (more than either of us would care to admit). We are fiery, messy, complicated, sensitive, and deeply feeling people. Those who don’t know her well might sum her up as “emotional”. While this assessment isn’t entirely inaccurate, it doesn’t paint the whole picture. 
  </p>


  <br>
  <h2>Her anger is as deep as her passion, 
    and her hurt is as deep as her love. </h2>

  <p>She has a particular sensitivity towards those who feel like they’re at rock bottom. She’s been there. An artist through and through, she is more talented than she’ll ever believe, and creative beyond imagination.  Pictures of her and I when I was younger evoke a visceral feeling of raw mother-daughter connection in me; the kind of feeling that makes you forget your pain instantly. Her touch is magnetic – her hands are scarred but gentle as could be. 
  </p>

  <h2>She is complicated, broken, healed, and utterly beautiful.
  </h2>

<h1>Mamaw</h1>


<p>When I was younger, I believed baths to be the bane of my existence. Mamaw, never putting up with any of my whining, would say,

  <div class="column">
    <img src="images/mamaw's-handwriting.png" alt="mamaw-handwriting" style="width:50%">
  </div>

<p>to remind me that my suffering would only be temporary. As silly as it sounds, to me, this is a lesson about fortitude and resilience. Mamaw’s gentle toughness, quiet efficiency, and determination to see the best in everyone, inspire me to no end. She will stop at nothing to make sure everyone in her surrounding vicinity is fed and happy. Every trip to Mamaw’s house is accompanied by the inevitable,

<h2>“Have you eaten?”</h2>

<p>and</p>

<h2>“I made you your favorite!”</h2>

  </div>

<p>and of course, before you leave her home, a goodie bag full of treats. She would fight to the death to protect her children and grandchildren. Nobody crosses the Mamaw. She is a talented pianist, home cook, and an absolute powerhouse of a woman. The thought of her evokes the smell of southern cooking wafting through the air, the sound of church songs on the piano, and her effortlessly beautiful handwriting.</p>

  <h2>Her love is quiet but unwavering; its expression is clear only to those attuned to the subtle. </h2>

  <h2>Home is watching Yolande carefully cut carrots into perfectly uniform slices for my lunchbox.</h2>

  <p>I’m not religious, but there isn’t a doubt in my mind that Yolande is an angel. She and my dad were married and divorced long before I was born. Despite their complicated past, she and my dad raised me as friends after my mom and dad split. She has always been like a second mother to me. From staying over late to help me with my homework for hours on end, to sleeping on my trundle bed to protect me from monsters (well into my middle school years), to packing my school lunches with a home cooked meal, she never missed a beat.  She is one of those rare people who puts everyone else first. She is disciplined, kind, understanding, patient, perceptive, and brilliant, without ever asking for credit or thanks. Her touch is careful, gentle, and precise touch is well suited for her job as an electron-microscopist.</p>

  <p>My dad is my best friend, but it hasn’t always been that way. I used to resent him for pushing me to the brink of insanity in school, and enforcing such strict rules in my life. Now, I understand. He expects nothing but my best from me. He is a gentle giant, a teddy bear with a solemn exterior. Whenever I ask him how he came to be such a stoic, he sighs and says, with an air of humility,</p>

  <p>This is damn near impossible for me to believe since I’m convinced that he hung the moon. I almost never see him make the same mistake twice. There isn’t a single thing he knows about the world that he didn’t learn by himself, the hard way. He is tough, quirky, curious, creative, and passionate. He’s the single most intelligent human being I have ever met. He is a man of few words, but every word he speaks is carefully crafted, so as to express his ideas as succinctly as possible. He is constantly taking the temperature of every room he in, to make sure that everyone feels safe and included. As a passionate academic, he is well suited for his job as a professor of Materials Science and Engineering, and the founder of Verco Materials LLC, a bulletproof armor company. His ability to tinker, stick with a problem until it’s solved, and hear every perspective before forming an opinion, bewilder me. His expo marker dust covered hands have always been there to pat my head, and count my fingers and toes when I am sad; his unique way of saying, </p>

<p>I know that family is not chosen. I was raised by a whole slew of people beyond those mentioned in this book; School teachers, friends, friend’s parents, concierge desk workers at my home apartments, and more. I am a proponent of complicated families, full of complicated people. I am proud to have been raised by such a vibrant and beautiful village. I, like my mother, am incredibly sensitive. I have a rather unfortunate talent for seeing everything wrong with the world, all at once. My head is not always a nice home. 
</p>

<h2>But alas, the mind is the one place we can never really escape. </h2>

<p>While my relationships with my loved ones relationships do sustain me, the most important relationship I will ever have, is with myself. As I search for meaning and purpose in life, I take with me the lessons I learn from my them, and from my every mistake. This body that houses my soul, is also a vessel for others to pour their humanity into. I will always be my own home, and I aspire to be a home for others in honor of my loved ones.</p>

<h2>I am grateful for my body, for the wonders my eyes have seen, the music my ears have heard, and the hands my hands have held.</h2>
